You can use, for instance, titles, subtitles, bold text, vertical list of bullets (like you did in Presentation part) and so on. So, please, make your plan looks better cuz now it's difficult to read it. Also, please, add the short project description. It's a good practice for any project you will work on. You can even just copy-paste it from notion:) </div> "

    "\n",
    "In this project I will look at the data from the virtual telephony company and work on finding the least profitable operators with the help of that data. I will also try developping a new function that will give supervisors information on the least effective operators. According to the instructions from the company,  an operator is considered ineffective if the following is true.\n",
    "### First: many missed calls.\n",
    "If the operator has a large number of missed incoming calls (internal and external) it is considered a bad sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Second: long waiting time.\n",
    "If there is a long waiting time for incoming calls, it is also a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Third: too few outgoing calls.\n",
    "It is concerning if an operator is supposed to make outgoing calls but there is a relatively small number of them recorded."
